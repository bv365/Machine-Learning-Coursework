This repository is a collection of homework assignments and projects for my machine learning course.
Homework 1 Instructions:
  Find a large dataset, clean it up, and perform multi-linear regression using scikit learn and a class of my own
  
Homework 2 Instructions:
  Find a dataset with many quanititative variables and remedy overfitting using Ridge Regression
  
Homework 3 Instructions:
  Use a grid search to find optimal parameters for Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression.
  Use a grid search to find optimal parameters for a Support Vector Classifier and produce a Confusion Matrix

Homework 4 Instructions:
  Create a Support Vector Classifier using Radial Basis Functions for a kernel. Use a grid search to find optimal parameters.
  Create a Confusion Matrix for the SVC.

Homework 7 Instructions:
  Do something interesting with clustering.
  What I did was take country data that looked at economic and health related data and clustered them using KMeans clustering.
  Included is a color-coded map that highlights the clusters.
